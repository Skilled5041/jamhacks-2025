# Mr Goose
🏆 **1st place @ JamHacks 2025**

## Description

Mr. Goose is a helpful all-in-one VS Code extension that supports beginners while still encouraging learning through problem-solving. Mr. Goose is a chaotic but charming assistant that reacts to your code, nudges you when you’re stuck, and offers help in ways that don’t give away full solutions — just hints, encouragement, and occasional honks.

Instead of doing the work for you, Mr. Goose promotes exploration and thought. It mimics having a quirky friend in the editor, encouraging you to reason through errors rather than blindly pasting code. By combining humour, interactivity, and just the right amount of support, we aim to reinforce learning without removing the challenge.

Key Features:

- 🪿 Animated Goose Companion: A goose appears in a sidebar, animated via frame-based sprite switching, with a chat feature to ask for help.
- 📜 Live Code Feedback: The extension listens for file changes and suggests logical error fixes for the latest code from the active editor.
- 🔍 Goose Pointer: A goose icon appears next to your cursor and error locations, providing a unique and fun way to highlight focus or mistakes.
- 🔧 Fill-in-the-blank Guidance via Goose: Through goose commands, send code snippets to a dedicated panel, opening a new interactive interface for code exercises or review.
- 💬 Dialogue and Sound Effects: The goose can “honk” or speak in retro dialogue sounds triggered by commands, adding a layer of personality.
